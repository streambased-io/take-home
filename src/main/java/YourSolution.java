        3 topics already exist and are being written to:

        1. basic - boring old producing
        2. transactional - transactional producing with random aborted transactions
        3. compacting - compacting topic with small segment.ms

        You code here should print the number of messages in Kafka on each topic. For the
        transactional topic you should include the number of uncommitted messages too.

        This should not be a continuous execution. This method should return in an "interactive"
        timescale, and it should be possible to execute it multiple times in a single verification
        run.

        Kafka connection details are available at Context.getKafkaConnectionProperties and the
        kafka-clients library has already been included for use.

        Check out docker-compose.yml for more information on the environment
